# Google-Assistant-for-spotting-the-train
Voice over Interface using google assistant for spotting the train
I have used railway api (https://railwayapi.com/) for this project. It is a paid version. During sign up they give some free credits.

To use this project:
1. Go to https://console.actions.google.com/
2. Click on new project and name it
3. Click on Develop -> Actions -> Custom Intent -> Build
4. Signin/signup the Dilogflow (if not already logged in)
5. Click on stting icon (below the "Dilogflow logo" top left) and then go to Export and Import.
6. Click on import from zip and add this project into your zip file and upload
7. Once imported you can use this voice over interface of spot the train in your device.
8. You can also share this project using share options in setting (the same setting option that was used during Export and Import)

**(Google assistant not calls external API if you are using free firebase plan (Spark). You have to use Pay as you go plan (Blaze) for this project)
